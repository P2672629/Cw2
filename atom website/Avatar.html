<p> James Cameron the maker of avatar one m=now talking about avatar two, james is the creater of many things like
  he talks about what it was like making alien and what it was like working with the actors. He then
   speaks about Terminator two and about how he got the main actor to work on terminator two as she
   said she would only do it if she could be crazy so he agreed and an amazing sequel was made. One
   of my favroute films that James has ever made would have to be Titanic witch he speaks a lot about in
   this interview, he talks about how the other films he made before gave him the knowledge to pull off
   this amazing film that effects all our hearts. He talks about how originally there was meant to be a love
    affair between bill paxton and suzy amis but was cut as James realized that the people were only interested in
     the main romance between jack and rose, and obversly Avatar. </p>
